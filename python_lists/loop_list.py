#Loop through the Index numbers--------------
# you can also loop through the list items by referring their index number
"""use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable"""
"""thisList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thisList)):
    print(thisList[i])"""

#Using a While Loop
"""you can loop through the list items by using a WHILE loop
Use the len() function to determine the length of the list, then start at 0
and loop your way through the list items by reffering to their indexes
remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration"""

"""thisList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thisList):
    print(thisList[i])
    i+=1"""
